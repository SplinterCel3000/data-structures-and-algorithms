***[Problem Domain for the Code Challenge]***

C#: a method called public static bool MultiBracketValidation(string input) 
Your function should take a string as its only argument, and should return a boolean representing whether or not the brackets in the string are balanced. There are 3 types of brackets:

Round Brackets : ()
Square Brackets : []
Curly Brackets : {}
