# Singly Linked List
This was all about linked lists and how they work with each other and how they work with different tests. 

## Challenge
Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the Node, and a pointer to the next Node.
Within your LinkedList class, include a head property. Upon instantiation, an empty Linked List should be created.
Define a method called insert which takes any value as an argument and adds a new node with that value to the head of the list with an O(1) Time performance.
Define a method called includes which takes any value as an argument and returns a boolean result depending on whether that value exists as a Node’s value somewhere within the list.
Define a method called toString (or __str__ in Python) which takes in no arguments and returns a string representing all the values in the Linked List, formatted as:
"{ a } -> { b } -> { c } -> NULL"
Any exceptions or errors that come from your code should be semantic, capturable errors. For example, rather than a default error thrown by your language, your code should raise/throw a custom, semantic error that describes what went wrong in calling the methods you wrote for this lab.
Be sure to follow your language/frameworks standard naming conventions (e.g. C# uses PascalCasing for all method and class names).

## Approach & Efficiency
We made this in class together and all worked on it as a group. It took roughly an hour and a half to complete.

### Problem Domain
***[Problem Domain for the Code Challenge]***

Write a method for the Linked List class which takes a number, k, as a parameter. Return the node’s value that is k from the end of the linked list.

### Inputs and Expected Outputs

| Input | Expected Output |
| :----------- | :----------- |
| head -> [1] -> [3] -> [8] -> [2] -> X | 2 |
